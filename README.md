#vDecoder

###vSummary
This is a program in Python I have written to take in a list of numbers, convert that into hex bits, make the hex bits into string, and then write to a file.

### Requirements
To run this, you will need [Python 3](python.org) on your system.

Once you have that installed, clone this repository, navigate to the directory, and simple type in `python encoder.py`
