# Decoder

### Summary
This is a program in Python I have written to take in a list of numbers, convert that into hex bits, make the hex bits into string, and then write to a text file.  After it encodes, it take a list of hex values and converts them to integers and saves those to a text file as ell.

It is an exercise to experiment without using any libraries to observe byte manipulation.

### Requirements
To run this, you will need [Python 3](python.org) on your system.

### To Run
Once you have Python 3 installed, clone this repository, navigate to the directory, and simple type in `python encoder.py` and you're good to go.
